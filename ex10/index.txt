(a) Algorithm Analysis
It reorganizes items within three successive blocks, I, I+1, and I+2 of a file with the following work: 

1. The number of items in block I+2 is updated from a computed value ( Q + R ), where:
(Q = text{Quotient}(2B+ text{Buf.nb}, 3)) 
(R = text{Rest}(2B + text{Buf.nb}, 3) ).


2. The blocks `I` and `I+1` are readjusted depending on whatever record have been shifted into the block `I+ 2`.
The algorithm works towards a nice distribution of records across the blocks in order to achieve an optimum level of efficiency leaving sufficient free space for further insertions.
In order to avoid fragmentation and to maintain the contents in blocks in proper balance,


(b) Example Execution:

- Let ( B = 8 ) this implies each block can hold not more than 8 items.
The problem statement gives that,
- Blocks ( I ) and ( I+1 ) full and block ( I+2 ) is partially filled.
- the blocks contain the following content:


| Block       | Items                  |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Block (I)   | A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H |
| Block (I+1) | I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P |
| Block (I+2) | Q, R, S                |


Final Contents of Blocks:

| Block       | Items               |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Block (I  ) | A, B, C, D          |
| Block (I+1) | I, J, K, L, E, F    |
| Block (I+2) | Q, R, S, M, N, O, P |
