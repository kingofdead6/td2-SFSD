/*### a) Characteristics of a Sequential File (TōF) for Integer Arrays

In a sequential file where integer arrays are stored, the array is divided into blocks. Each block has a capacity of `b` integers, except possibly the last one if the array size `n` is not a perfect multiple of `b`. The elements are stored in the file sequentially, and when reading, they are fetched block by block.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The file consists of blocks where each block can hold `b` integers.
- The array is stored sequentially, i.e., the first block contains elements from index `0` to `b-1`, the second block from index `b` to `2b-1`, and so on.
- The last block may not be fully filled if `n % b ≠ 0`.

**Declaration:**
In C, you would declare the structure to represent a file of blocks (i.e., the array) as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define B 1024  // Block size (number of integers per block)

typedef struct {
    int data[B];  // Block of integers
} Block;

typedef struct {
    FILE *file;    // Pointer to the file
    int blockSize; // The size of each block (usually B)
} SequentialFile;

```

In this declaration:
- `Block` is the structure that represents one block of integers.
- `SequentialFile` contains a pointer to the file (`file`) and the block size (`blockSize`).

### b) Efficient Algorithm to Compute the Average Value of the Elements in the Array

To compute the average of the elements in the array stored in the sequential file, you need to read through the blocks and sum up the elements, then divide the total sum by the number of elements (`n`).

**Algorithm:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

float compute_average(SequentialFile *seqFile, int n) {
    int totalSum = 0;
    int totalElements = n;
    Block block;
    
    // Iterate through blocks
    fseek(seqFile->file, 0, SEEK_SET); // Start reading from the beginning
    while (fread(&block, sizeof(Block), 1, seqFile->file)) {
        for (int i = 0; i < seqFile->blockSize && totalElements > 0; i++) {
            totalSum += block.data[i];
            totalElements--;
        }
    }
    
    // Compute the average
    return (float) totalSum / n;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `fread` reads each block from the file.
- For each block, we loop through its elements, adding them to `totalSum`.
- After reading all elements, we calculate the average by dividing `totalSum` by the total number of elements `n`.

### c) Efficient Algorithm to Perform Multiplication of Two Arrays

For performing the element-wise multiplication of two arrays, we can use a similar approach to the one used for computing the average. We will read corresponding blocks from both arrays, multiply the corresponding elements, and store the results.

**Algorithm:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void multiply_arrays(SequentialFile *seqFile1, SequentialFile *seqFile2, SequentialFile *resultFile, int n) {
    int totalElements = n;
    Block block1, block2, resultBlock;
    
    // Start reading from the beginning of both arrays
    fseek(seqFile1->file, 0, SEEK_SET);
    fseek(seqFile2->file, 0, SEEK_SET);
    
    while (fread(&block1, sizeof(Block), 1, seqFile1->file) &&
           fread(&block2, sizeof(Block), 1, seqFile2->file)) {
        
        // Perform element-wise multiplication for each block
        for (int i = 0; i < seqFile1->blockSize && totalElements > 0; i++) {
            resultBlock.data[i] = block1.data[i] * block2.data[i];
            totalElements--;
        }
        
        // Write the result to the result file
        fwrite(&resultBlock, sizeof(Block), 1, resultFile->file);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- We use two files (`seqFile1` and `seqFile2`) to hold the input arrays, and a third file (`resultFile`) to store the result.
- The function `fread` reads a block of data from both input files.
- For each pair of corresponding elements from the two blocks, we multiply them and store the result in the `resultBlock`.
- The result block is then written to the `resultFile`.

This algorithm efficiently handles the multiplication of large arrays stored in sequential files by processing the data block by block.*/
